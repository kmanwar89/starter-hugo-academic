Hi there!\
\
Welcome to my little slice of the Internet. My name is Kadar (pronounced like 'cotter') and I created this website to host personal projects, practice my project documentation skills and act as a living portfolio/resume for potential future employment. \
\
I make all information available publicly in the hopes it helps someone out one day.\
\
Please feel free to reach out to me at my contact info (below) if you read something helpful, had some suggestions to offer or maybe want to chat about a new career opportunity.

Cheers, and thanks for reading!
